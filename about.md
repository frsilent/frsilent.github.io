# About Me

My name is Roland Heintze and I work as a Django developer out of the Tampa area.

I have a wide variety of interests in technology and as a result have managed to tinker with a wide variety of languages and tools.
This site seeks to detail various discoveries and resources that I find. I'll do this via blog posts with various code snippets, links,
and example screenshots. While I generally work with web, I possess a degree in computer science and remain interested in all applications of software engineering. So expect to see a little bit of everything in the following pages.
