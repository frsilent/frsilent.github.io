# About Me

My name is Roland Heintze and I live in Jacksonville, FL.
I have a wide variety of interests in technology and as a result have tinkered lots of languages, tools, & platforms.
This site seeks to provide a glance into my interests & some things I've learned along the way. I will attempt to do this with blog posts, various code snippets, links, and example screenshots. Expect to see a little bit of everything. :D
