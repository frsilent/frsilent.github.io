# About Me

My name is Roland Heintze and I work as a Django developer out of the Tampa area.
I have a wide variety of interests in technology and as a result have managed to tinker with a wide variety of languages and tools.
This site seeks to detail various discoveries and resources that I find. I'll attempt to do this with blog posts, various code snippets,
links, and example screenshots. While I work with web these days, I possess a degree in computer science and remain interested in all
applications of software engineering. So expect to see a little bit of everything in the following pages.
