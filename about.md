# About Me

My name is Roland and I live in Jacksonville, FL. I've been working remotely as a developer since 2014.
I have a wide variety of interests in technology and as a result have tinkered with lots of languages, tools, & platforms.
This site seeks to provide a glance into my interests & some things I've learned along the way.
I will attempt to do this with blog posts, various code snippets, links, and example screenshots.
Expect to see a little bit of everything. :D
